# Glove Piano

LilyPad project sown into a glove that allows users to produce 4 predetermined notes by touching the thump tip to the other four fingertips.
Each fingertip is associated to a separate note.  
  
The gloves use a touch sensor in the form of conductive thread, these patches will detect when a person touches them, but both patches have to be touched at the same time for the sensor to “feel” the touch. The patches are stitched onto to the fingertips of the gloves. The stiches on the thumb is attached the the negative pin on the LilyPad, while the other "keys" are connected to pins
A1-A4.
